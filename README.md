# Yet another 6502

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/veremenko-y/yet-another-6502.svg?branch=master)

Just a home project to understand for myself how cpu emulation works. It is not intended to be very vast, just correct. The goal is to write simple code which would be easy to read. If 6502 emulator works fine, I'll try to do some additional hardware or real computers where 6502 was used (Apple II, Commodore 64, NES etc).
All 56 official instructions implemented though there are few bugs with indexed LDA I'm trying to resolve.
